Examples of using Decorators in TypeScript 

The code in this repository is related to an article series, [Deep introduction to TypeScript decorators, metadata, and runtime data validation with decorators](https://techsparx.com/nodejs/typescript/decorators/introduction.html)

The articles in that series take a deep dive into all five types of TypeScript decorators (class decorators, method decorators, parameter decorators, property decorators, and accessor decorators).

The directories contain:

* `simple` - Example scripts used in the article series
* `decorator-inspectors` - A series of decorators that print out data from decorated objects
* `runtime-validators` - A framework for runtime data validation using decorators
